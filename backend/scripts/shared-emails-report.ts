/**
 * Which emails in this CRM are held by two or more different people — clients
 * finance would file under one customer, since it knows a client by the email
 * alone (one email, one client: the user, 2026-10-10). Leads and students
 * together, grouped by the email trimmed and lower-cased; "different people" as
 * the close decides it (src/utils/clientEmail.ts): both phones known and a
 * different number (last nine digits), else a different name — and a student
 * is always the same person as the lead it was closed from.
 *
 * Read only. It never writes and takes no option that would: no models are
 * loaded (their index builds write), dotenv is never read, and anything but
 * --json is refused.
 *
 * Run from backend/, naming the database outright — `--no-env-file` keeps bun
 * from loading backend/.env, which names the LIVE database:
 *
 *   MONGODB_URI='mongodb+srv://USER:PASS@HOST/draw_crm' bun --no-env-file scripts/shared-emails-report.ts
 *   MONGODB_URI='…' bun --no-env-file scripts/shared-emails-report.ts --json > shared-emails.json
 *
 * Prints, per shared email: the email masked (its first two characters, ***,
 * @domain), how many records hold it, and each record — student or lead, its
 * name, the enrolment number or the lead's id, its status. Never a phone number.
