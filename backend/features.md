**Services**: `mentorService` proxies to the LMS through `lmsClient`; the LMS remains the source of truth for schedules, availability, and meetings.

**Configuration**: `LMS_API_URL`, `LMS_SERVICE_SECRET`, and `LMS_REMOTE_ORG_ID`.

**Permissions**: Any signed-in user can browse and book. The LMS enforces ownership and configured Super Admin overrides for meeting changes.

**Change Log**: Ported the Sales CRM mentor booking integration.

---

## 19. Course mapping — finance products and LMS courses

**Description**: Each course can be mapped to the Delta Finance product it bills against and to every LMS course a student gets for it (two for a bundle). Every enrolment then carries both, so finance bills the right product and its approval opens every course.

**Routes**: `GET /api/v1/courses/finance-items`, `GET /api/v1/courses/lms-courses` (both `authenticate` → `checkPermission("leads", "edit")`, before `/:id`), and `PUT /api/v1/courses/:id` now accepting `financeItemId` and `lmsCourseSlugs`.

**Services**: `courseService` (mapping fields), `lmsClient.listLmsCourses`, `financeClient.listFinanceItems`, `StudentService.buildHandoverPayload` (per-course `lmsCourseSlugs`). Bulk scripts: `mapFinanceItems.ts`, `mapLmsCourses.ts`.

**Model**: `Course.lmsCourseSlugs: string[]` (first also kept in `lmsCourseSlug`).

**Tests**: `scripts/course-mapping-e2e.sh` — throwaway mongod, no `.env`, stand-in finance and LMS; the four cases.

**Change Log**: 2026-09-29 — added.

---

## 20. Enrolment at the close — the way Delta CRM closes (2026-10-02)

**Description**: Closing a lead takes the enrolment finance needs, the same as Delta CRM's close: at least one course, the client's email (kept on the lead when it had none), language, payment method, the payment receipt (uploaded to the bucket finance reads), and whether a bonus was given, with its amount. The enrolment goes to Delta Finance straight away — billed into Delta HQ, `source: "draw-crm"` — with the balance (fee − paid, the bonus never in it) and the bonus beside it, and waits in finance's Approvals like any CRM enrolment.

**Routes**: `POST /api/v1/students/receipts/:leadId` (new — multipart `file`, JPG/PNG/WebP/HEIC/PDF, ≤ 10 MB; `authenticate` → `checkPermission("students", "create")`); `POST /api/v1/students` now refuses a close missing any of the above (422, all named at once); `PUT /api/v1/students/:id` takes `hasBonus` / `bonusAmount` and keeps a `feeStatus` set by hand.

**Services**: `StudentService.createStudent` (required fields, `fillLeadEmail`), `updateStudent` (bonus), `buildHandoverPayload` (`balanceMinor`, `bonus`), `queueFinanceHandover` (sends at once via `kickFinanceHandover`), `requestInvoice` (says so when an enrolment has no course); `lib/storage.ts` (R2 — the same bucket and variable names as finance and Delta CRM).

**Model**: `Student.hasBonus` (unset on enrolments from before it was asked), `Student.bonusAmount`.

**Env**: `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `R2_PUBLIC_URL` — the values Delta CRM's backend holds (`R2_ENDPOINT` is for tests only). Unset, a receipt cannot be taken, so nobody can close. Finance as before: `FINANCE_API_URL`, `FINANCE_CLIENT_ID`, `FINANCE_INTEGRATION_SECRET` (Delta CRM's values) and `FINANCE_ORG_ID` = Delta HQ.

**Tests**: `scripts/enrolment-close-e2e.sh` — throwaway mongod, two backends (with and without storage), stand-in finance and bucket; the four cases, 53 checks.

**Change Log**: 2026-10-02 — added.

---

## 21. A course's bonus (2026-10-04)

**Description**: Each course can carry the bonus a client gets with it (`bonusAmount`, in the course's currency; 0 for none), set when the course is created or edited on the Courses page. A new close starts from it — "Bonus given?" answered yes with the chosen courses' bonuses added up — and the seller can change it, or say no, for a sale that differs. An enrolment being edited keeps what it has.

**Routes**: `POST /api/v1/courses` and `PUT /api/v1/courses/:id` accept `bonusAmount` (a number ≥ 0); every course read returns it, and the lead reads (`GET /api/v1/leads`, `GET /api/v1/leads/:id`) now populate it on the lead's courses.

**Model**: `Course.bonusAmount: number` (default 0; a course from before reads as none).

**Tests**: `scripts/course-bonus-e2e.sh` — throwaway mongod, no `.env`; the four cases.

**Change Log**: 2026-10-04 — added (the owner: "bonus adding option in the course create and edit", in all three sales CRMs).

---

## Commission (2026-10-04)

**Description**: A commission plan per course — Sales Staff / TL / SM in AED per approved sale, and the MT5 credit (USD) the course comes with — and what each sale finance approves earns. Recorded once, when the finance worker sees the enrolment approved, with the plan of that day; counted in the month the sale was made (UAE time). TL_RULE "never": no TL is paid: a sale pays its closer (Sales Staff) and the Sales Manager (SM) only, and needs no team or team leader; the SM who closes earns Sales Staff too. Shared logins (settings) earn nobody anything; a voided invoice reverses the sale.

**Routes** (`authenticate` only — everyone sees their own; the service narrows it): `GET /api/v1/commission/plan`, `GET /api/v1/commission/earnings?month=YYYY-MM` (own / team / all), `GET /api/v1/commission/preview?course=&team=&closer=` (for the closing dialog, nothing saved); Super Admin only: `PUT /api/v1/commission/plan/:courseId` `{ sales, tl, sm, creditUsd }`, `PUT /api/v1/commission/settings` `{ salesManager, excludedUsers }`.

**Models**: `Course.commission`, `CommissionSettings` (`commissionsettings`, key "default"), `CommissionSale` (`commissionsales`, one per student), `FinanceHandover.approvedAt` / `commissionAt`.

**Tests**: `scripts/commission-check.sh` — throwaway mongod, no `.env`, a stand-in for finance; rules, scoping, preview and the API's refusals (follows TL_RULE).

**Change Log**: 2026-10-04 — added (the owner: commission per portal from the "Course Commission Plans" image; Sales Manager Maneesh Babusenan; excluded logins Super Admin (superadmin@crm.com), Sample BDE (bde@crm.com), root user).

---

## An enrolment's five steps — and commission only once they're done (2026-10-04)

**Description**: After the close every enrolment shows five steps — Finance approved → LMS account → CS assigned (Tetra Commission) → Onboarded (welcome sent) → MT5 bonus approved by a broker admin (approved by itself when no bonus was promised) — green done, yellow waiting, red stopped, grey not known / not needed (a course Tetra Commission doesn't take skips 3–5). Commission counts only once all are done, for sales closed from 1 October 2026 (UAE), in the month closed; until then the sale is "progress", saying which step it waits on.

**Routes**: `GET /api/v1/students/enrolments/mine` rows carry `steps`; `GET /api/v1/students/enrolments/:id` (`authenticate` only, like My Enrolments here, before `/:id`) — the enrolment's own page: steps with who/when, and its commission (own lines; all for a Super Admin or the Sales Manager); the closer, or anyone with students:view.

**Services**: `enrolmentSteps.stepsOf / allDone / waitingOn`; `commissionService.trackSales` (every two minutes) replaces recording at approval.

**Tests**: `scripts/commission-check.sh` — the steps, one at a time; no bonus; not Forex; Tetra Commission silent; counted early under the old rule; void; finance down; the enrolment endpoint.

**Change Log**: 2026-10-04 — added (the owner: "finance approved => lms created account => commission portal get cs => onboarded => mt5 bonus approved, then only they get the commission").

## View as — a super admin sees the CRM as someone else (2026-10-05)

**Description**: A super admin opens the CRM as any active user who is not a super admin, for 30 minutes, read only: every page
answers exactly as it does for that person, and every change is refused ("View only…"). The Remote CRM's "View as"
(dilshad-crm 343947d), brought here unchanged.

**Routes**: see middlewareHistory.md → "View as (2026-10-05)".

**Service Methods**: `impersonationService.start / stop`; `checkImpersonation` in `middleware/auth.ts`;
`utils/jwt.signImpersonationToken`; `utils/requestMeta` (`clientIp`, `describeDevice` — for the session record);
`requireSuperAdmin` in `middleware/permissions.ts`.

**Models Used**: `Impersonation` (new — the session: admin, target, IP, device, start, expiry, end; kept a year); `User`, `Role`.

**Tests**: `scripts/view-as-check.sh` — 39 checks in the four cases, on a throwaway database.

**Change Log**:
- 1.0.0 — Initial build. No screen lists past sessions yet (they are in the `impersonations` collection).

## Split payments at the close — and nothing collected above the fee (2026-10-05)

**Description**: A client may pay in more than one way — 300 in cash and 200 by card on a 500 fee — and each payment has its
own method, amount and receipt. A close sends `payments[]`; they must add up to `paidAmount`, and what was collected may never
be more than the fee, on a close or on an edit that changes the money. Finance gets every payment with its receipt and records
them against the invoice when it approves.

**Routes**: `POST /api/v1/students` (unchanged route; takes `payments`), `PUT /api/v1/students/:id` (refuses an edit that leaves
paid above the fee).

**Service Methods**: `checkedPayments`, `assertNotOverFee` in `studentService.ts`; `buildHandoverPayload` sends `payments`.

**Models Used**: `Student.payments` (new: method, amount, receipt, paidAt, collectedBefore).

**Tests**: `scripts/split-payments-check.sh` — 27 checks in the four cases.

**Change Log**:
- 1.0.0 — Initial build. An older screen (one method, one receipt) still closes.

## Notifications for sheet leads, test notifications, and VAPID key changes (2026-10-05)

**Description**: New-lead notifications weren't reaching people (the user, 2026-10-05).
- A sheet lead given straight to somebody (`assigned_to` — as when Root's split names one person) now tells them at
  once, on the website (the live connection) and on their devices: one alert per lead, or one per batch with the
  count. It used to tell nobody; only the team split notified.
- `POST /api/v1/push/test` (as in the Sales CRM): a test notification to every device the signed-in person enabled,
  only them — "Sent to 2 of 3 devices"; 409 when nothing is enabled yet, 429 within 10 seconds of the last test.
- `sendPushToUser` returns `{ devices, delivered }`, logs a failed send, and drops a device registered with another
  VAPID key (403 — as after the keys are changed) as it drops a gone one (404/410). The website registers the device
  again with the current key when it is next opened.

**Tests**: `scripts/push-test-check.sh` — 20 checks in six cases (web-push's send replaced by a stand-in; a real
socket.io connection for the website side).

**Change Log**:
- 1.0.0 — Initial build, ported from the Sales CRM.
