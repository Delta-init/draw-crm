 * An enrolment waiting to reach Delta Finance.

 * being up. A salesperson who cannot record a sale because finance is
 * restarting is a worse outcome than an invoice that appears a minute late, so
 * the student is created first and this row is what remembers to deliver it.
 *
 * One row per student, and the student's id is what finance is given as the
 * idempotency key — a retry after a timeout finds the invoice that already
 * exists rather than billing the client twice.
