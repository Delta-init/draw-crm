 * restarting is a worse outcome than an invoice that appears a minute late, so
 * the student is created first and this row is what remembers to deliver it.

 * One row per student, and the student's id is what finance is given as the
 * idempotency key — a retry after a timeout finds the invoice that already
 * exists rather than billing the client twice.
