/**
 * One sale and the commission it earns.
 *
 * Followed from the close ("progress", saying which of its five steps it waits
 * on — enrolmentSteps.ts) and decided once every step is done, from the plan as
 * it stands then — so a plan changed in March leaves February's sales as they
 * were paid.
 * One per student: the unique index is what makes recording it twice
 * impossible, whichever sweep gets there first.
 *
 * Who earns it is decided once too, and only redone while the sale is waiting
 * or excluded — a counted sale is never recomputed, because "who led the team
 * when it sold" must not change because somebody moved teams later.
