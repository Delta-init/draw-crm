/**
 * A lead given to someone arrives as a new lead for them (the owner,
 * 2026-10-09): its created date becomes the moment it was handed over, so it
 * sits in their Today's Leads, and its status goes back to Assigned. The first
 * created date is kept once, in originalCreatedAt; notes, calls, follow-ups and
 * the activity log stay as they were.
 *
 * A hand-over is a lead getting a different owner — assign, the team split,
 * auto-assign, bulk assign, a member reassign, an Inactive Leads reassign — or
 * moving to a different team, where it is new for that team's queue until the
 * split gives it to someone (its status is then left as the transfer set it).
 * This lives on the model, not in each of those paths, so all of them follow it.
 *
 * Not a hand-over: a lead created already assigned (an import keeps its
 * dates), the same owner or team set again, unassigning, and a closed or lost
 * lead, whose status is tied to its enrolment, commission or reason.
