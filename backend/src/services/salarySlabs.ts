/*
 * The salary slabs (the user, 2026-10-07: "Commission & Salary Slab — Sales
 * Staff" and "Team Draw — Maneesh as Sales Manager"; the same sheet the Remote
 * CRM uses for dilshad). One ladder per role: the month's approved sales reach
 * a level, and the level pays a salary plus a percent of the commission earned
 * that month. The first row of each is the base, at target 0 — what a month
 * below the first level pays (Sales Staff 2,000 at 0%, as E; the Sales Manager
 * 5,000 at 50%, as at 120,000).
 *
 * Two slabs here, not the Sales CRM's three: no Team Leader slab — a team
 * leader is paid on the Sales Staff slab, on their own sales (TL_SLAB).
 *
 * Kept as versions: a change is in force from the month it was made in (UAE)
 * until the next one, so changing the slabs in November leaves October's pay
 * as it was. With none saved, the sheet below.
