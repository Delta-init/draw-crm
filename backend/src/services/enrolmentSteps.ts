 * An enrolment's journey after the close, in five steps (the user, 2026-10-04):
 *
 *   1. Finance approved   accounts approved the enrolment
 *   2. LMS account        the student's LMS account exists, on the course
 *   3. CS assigned        Tetra Commission gave them a CS
 *   4. Onboarded          their CS sent the welcome
 *   5. MT5 bonus          a broker admin approved the bonus promised at the
 *                         close — approved by itself when none was promised
 *
 * Shown on every My Enrolments card and on the enrolment's own page, green /
 * yellow / red; and a sale's commission counts only once all five are done
 * (commissionService). Worked out from finance's answer for the enrolment —
 * which carries the LMS and Tetra Commission's side — and the outbox's own
 * record, for what happened before finance had it. A course Tetra Commission
 * does not take (not Forex) skips steps 3–5: there is nobody there to do them.
