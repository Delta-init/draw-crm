/*
 * Sales commission: a plan per course (Sales Staff / TL / SM, in AED), and
 * what each approved sale earns under it.
 *
 * The rules, as the business set them (2026-10-04):
 *   - every sale finance approves pays three people: whoever closed it (Sales
 *     Staff), the leader of its team (TL) and the Sales Manager (SM);
 *   - one Sales Manager for the whole CRM. A team he leads himself gets no TL
 *     amount — he is paid as SM, not twice;
 *   - a TL or SM who closes a sale is paid the Sales Staff amount as well;
 *   - one leader per team: a sale in a team with none, or two, waits until the
 *     team is fixed, and is listed so somebody fixes it;
 *   - sales closed under a shared login (root user, superadmin, developer)
 *     earn nobody anything.
 *
 * Counted once the sale's five steps are all done (the user, 2026-10-04):
 * finance approved, LMS account, CS assigned, onboarded, and the MT5 bonus a
 * broker admin approved — approved by itself when none was promised. With the
 * amounts of that day, in the month the sale was made (UAE time), for sales
 * closed from 1 October 2026 on. Until then the sale is "progress", saying
 * which step it waits on. A sale whose invoice finance voids is reversed.
 */

/**
 * How this CRM pays a team's leader — the one line that differs between the
 * three sales CRMs, which otherwise run this same code:
 *   "zero_if_sm"  the leader is paid the TL amount, except on a team the Sales
 *                 Manager leads himself, where it is 0 (Sales CRM)
 *   "always"      the leader is paid the TL amount — the Sales Manager too when
 *                 he leads the team, so one person earns both (Remote CRM)
 *   "never"       no TL amount at all, so a sale needs no team leader (Draw)
