/**
 * Answering the Root portal's questions about this CRM's people.
 *
 * The portal is where access across the estate is decided: who may open what,
 * and as whom. It could already sign somebody in here, but it could not see
 * what it had done — the role it recorded was whatever an administrator had
 * typed into a box, and the two could drift apart for months with the portal
 * still reporting the one it remembered.
 *
 * So this answers three things: which roles this CRM actually has, what one
 * account actually holds, and — when asked — changes it. Provisioning is the
 * fourth, and deliberately separate: a grant says where somebody may go, and
 * creating an account makes them exist here, which is a larger act.
