/*
 * A month's salary and commission on the salary slabs (the user, 2026-10-05,
 * this Sales CRM only).
 *
 *   - what a target counts: the course fee of each sale finance has approved
 *     and not voided, in the month the sale was closed (UAE) — the month its
 *     commission is counted in;
 *   - Sales Staff count the sales they closed; a Team Leader their team's sales,
 *     their own closes in it included; the Sales Manager every sale in the CRM,
 *     shared logins' included. A shared login's sale counts for nobody else;
 *   - one slab a person: the Sales Manager is on the SM slab even on the team
 *     he leads, a team leader on the TL slab;
 *   - the level is the highest whose target the month's sales reach, the base
 *     below the first;
 *   - pay = the level's salary + the commission earned that month × its
 *     percent. The commission is every line the person earned, in any role, on
 *     the month's counted sales — so a team leader's own closes are in it.
 *
 * Worked out when asked, from the records the commission sweep keeps; nothing
 * is stored. A month's figures move while its sales are still approved,
 * counted or voided.
