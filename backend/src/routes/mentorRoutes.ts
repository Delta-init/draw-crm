 * Open to anybody signed in — no permission check, by decision. Booking an
 * hour with a mentor is work the people doing the work do; a calendar only
 * some of them can see is one they have to ask somebody else to read for
 * them. The same reasoning the Root portal, which reads this same LMS, was
 * already built on.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches into the LMS on the viewer's behalf beyond what it
 * already authorises for itself: listing one academy's mentors, and booking,
 * reading, changing or cancelling one meeting. Editing or cancelling
 * somebody else's is the LMS's call, not this router's — it checks who
 * booked it, or whether this CRM's own super admin is asking.
