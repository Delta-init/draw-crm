 * Closing a lead goes through its enrolment.

 * through the enrolment taken here — the courses, the fee, what was paid, the
 * receipt, whether a bonus was given. A lead that reaches "closed" any other
 * way is one neither of them ever learns of. So every way of closing — the
 * status menu, a card dropped on Closed, several leads at once — opens this
 * dialog, and only saving it closes the lead. The same rule Delta CRM holds.

 * loaded, and the fee, the balance and the invoice all come from those two.
